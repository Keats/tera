# Changelog

## 0.11.0 (unreleased)

### Breaking changes

- Tests parentheses are now mandatory if there are arguments (`divisibleby 2` -> `divisibleby(2)`)
- Tests can be only used on variables now, not on expressions
- Escaping happens immediately now instead of waiting for the filters to be called unless `safe` is first, 
if you want the old behaviour you will need to start the a chain of filters with `| safe` as the first one

### Others

- Tests, global functions calls and macro calls are now expressions and can be combined like so: `if x is divisibleby(2) and x > 10`
- Add default arguments for macro arguments
- Add whitespace management similar to Liquid and Jinja2
- Add parentheses to expressions to remove ambiguities
- Block & macro end tag name are no longer mandatory and it doesn't error on mismatched names between
the start and end tag anymore
- Filters can now be applied to expressions
- Add modulo operator `%` for math expressions
- Allow comment tags before the extend tag
- Make `NaiveDateTime` work with the `date` filter
- `pluralize` filter now returns the plural suffix for 0 thing as it's apparently what English does
- Add a `set_global` tag that allows you to set something in the global context: meant to be used in forloops where
the normal `set` would put the value into the loop context
- Add `starting_with` and `ending_with` tests
- Add a `json_encode` filter
