## 1.0.0 (2019-12-07)

### Breaking changes

- Now requires Rust 1.34
- Removed error-chain errors and added rich Error enum instead
- Filter, Tester and Function are now traits and now take borrowed values instead of owned
- Updated for 2018 edition
- Require macros import to be at the top of the files along with `extends` as it is fairly cheap and
the code already only really look there.

- Pluralize filter now uses `singular` and `plural` arguments instead of `suffix`
- Add a test for checking whether a variable is an object
- Escaping now happens before inserting the final result of an expression: no need anymore to add `| safe` everywhere,
only at the last position
- Remove `safe` argument of the urlencode filter, `/` is still escaped by default
- The `compile_templates!` macro has been removed

### Others

If you want the old behaviour you will need to start the a chain of filters with `| safe` as the first one

- Allow comment tags before the extend tag
- Make `NaiveDateTime` work with the `date` filter
- `pluralize` filter now returns the plural suffix for 0 thing as it's apparently what English does

the normal `set` would put the value into the loop context
- Add `starting_with`, `ending_with` and `containing` tests
- Add `json_encode`, `default` and `sort` filters
