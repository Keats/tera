## Introduction
Tera is a template engine based on [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) and the [Django template language](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/templates/).

It is subject to lots of API changes as users provide feedback.

While Tera is inspired by the engines above, it doesn't have the backward compatibility to maintain and we can improve on those if possible. One of the goal is to avoid putting too much logic in the templates so it's closer to the Django ones in that respect, except it has math operations built-in.

Example of a template file:

```jinja
<html>
  <head>
    <title>{{ product.name }}</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>{{ product.name }} - {{ product.manufacturer }}</h1>
    <p>{{ product.summary }}</p>
    <p>Â£{{ product.price * 1.20 }} (VAT inc.)</p>
    {% if friend_reviewed %}
      <p>Look at reviews from your friends {{ username }}</p>
      {% if number_reviews > 10 || show_more %}
        <p>All reviews</p>
        {% for review in reviews %}
          <h3>{{review.title}}</h3>
          {% for paragraph in review.paragraphs %}
            <p>{{ paragraph }}</p>
          {% endfor %}
        {% endfor %}
      {% elif number_reviews == 1 %}
        <p>Only one review</p>
      {% endif %}
    {% else %}
      <p>None of your friend reviewed this product</p>
    {% endif %}
    <button>Buy!</button>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Usage
Tera will load and parse all the templates in the given directory.

Let's take the following directory as example.
```bash
templates/
  hello.html
  index.html
  products/
    product.html
    price.html
```

Assuming the rust file is at the same level as the `templates` folder, we would parse the templates that way:

```rust
use tera::Tera;

// Use globbing
let tera = Tera::new("templates/**/*");
```

Tera will panic on invalid templates which means you should add template compilation as a build step when compiling. Have a look at that [page to learn more about build script](http://doc.crates.io/build-script.html).

This step is also meant to only be ran once, so you can use something like [lazy_static](https://crates.io/crates/lazy_static) to have the `tera` variable as a global static in your app.

If no errors happened while parsing any of the files, you can now render a template like so:

```rust
use tera::Context;

let mut context = Context::new();
context.add("product", &product);
context.add("vat_rate", &0.20);

tera.render("products/product.html", context);
```
Notice that the name of the template is based on the root of the template directory given to the Tera instance.
`Context` takes any primitive value or a struct that implements the `Serialize` trait from `serde_json`. 

## Template writer documentation
### Variables
You can access variables of the context by using the `{{ my_variable_name }}` construct. You can access attributes by using the dot (`.`) like `{{ product.name }}`.
You can also do some maths: `{{ product.price + 10 }}`. If `product.price` is not a number type, the `render` method will return an error.

### If
Similar to the if in Rust, you can have several conditions and also use `elif` and `else`:

```jinja`
{% if price < 10 || always_show %}
   Price is {{ price }}.
{% elif price > 1000 %}
   That's expensive!
{% else %}
    N/A
{% endif %}
```
The `if` statement has to end with a `endif` tag.

### For
Loop over items in a array:
```jinja
{% for product in products %}
  {{loop.index}}. {{product.name}}
{% endfor %}
```
A few special variables are available inside for loops like in jinja2:

- `loop.index`: current iteration 1-indexed
- `loop.index0`: current iteration 0-indexed
- `loop.first`: whether this is the first iteration
- `loop.last`: whether this is the last iteration

The `for` statement has to end with a `endfor` tag.

### Raw
Allow you to ignore texts that Tera would try to render otherwise.
```jinja
{% raw %}
  Hello {{ name }}
{% endraw %}
```
would be rendered:
```jinja
Hello {{ name }}
```


### Inheritance
Tera uses the same kind of inheritance as Jinja2 and django templates: you define a base template and extends it in child templates.

#### Base template
A base template typically contains the basic html structure as well as several `blocks` that can contain placeholders.
For example, here's a `base.html` almost copied from the jinja documentation:

```jinja
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    {% block head %}
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />
    <title>{% block title %}{% endblock title %} - My Webpage</title>
    {% endblock head %}
</head>
<body>
    <div id="content">{% block content %}{% endblock content %}</div>
    <div id="footer">
        {% block footer %}
        &copy; Copyright 2008 by <a href="http://domain.invalid/">you</a>.
        {% endblock footer %}
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```
The difference with Jinja being that `endblock` tags must be named.
This defines 4 `block` tag that child templates can override. The `head` and `footer` block contains some html already which will be rendered if they are not overrident.

#### Child template
Again, straight from jinja2 docs:

```jinja
{% extends "base.html" %}
{% block title %}Index{% endblock title %}
{% block head %}
    {{ super() }}
    <style type="text/css">
        .important { color: #336699; }
    </style>
{% endblock head %}
{% block content %}
    <h1>Index</h1>
    <p class="important">
      Welcome to my awesome homepage.
    </p>
{% endblock content %}
```

When trying to render that template, Tera will see that it depends on a parent template and will render it first, filling the blocks as it encounters them in the base template.


### Filters
Variables can be modified by filters. 
Filters are separated from the variable by a pipe symbol (`|`) and may have named arguments in parentheses. Multiple filters can be chained: the output of one filter is applied to the next.

For example, `{{ name | lower | replace(from="doctor", to="Dr.") }}` will take a variable called `name` and make it lowercase and then replace instances of `doctor` by `Dr.`. It's equivalent to `replace(lower(name), from="doctor", to="Dr.")` as a function.

Note that calling filters on a incorrect type like trying to capitalize an array will result in a error.

#### lower
Lowercase a string

#### wordcount
Returns number of words in a string

#### capitalize
Returns the string with all its character lowercased apart from the first char which is uppercased.

#### replace
Takes 2 mandatory string named arguments: `from` and `to`. It will return a string with all instances of 
the `from` string with the `to` string.

Example: `{{ name | replace(from="Robert", to="Bob")}}`

#### addslashes
Adds slashes before quotes.

Example: `{{ value | addslashes }}` 

If value is "I'm using Tera", the output will be "I\'m using Tera"

#### slugify
Transform a string into ASCII, lowercase it, trim it, converts spaces to hyphens and remove all characters that are not numbers, lowercase letters or hyphens.

Example: `{{ value | slugify}}`
If value is "-Hello world! ", the output will be "hello-world".

#### title
Capitalizes each word inside a sentence.

Example: `{{ value | title}}`
If value is "foo  bar", the output will be "Foo  Bar".

#### striptags
Tries to remove HTML tags from input. Does not guarantee well formed output if input is not valid HTML.

Example: `{{ value | striptags}}`
If value is "<b>Joel</b>", the output will be "Joel" 

#### first
Returns the first element of an array.
If the array is empty, returns empty string;

#### last
Returns the last element of an array.
If the array is empty, returns empty string;

#### join
Joins an array with a string.

Example: `{{ value|join:" // " }}`

If value is the array ['a', 'b', 'c'], the output will be the string "a // b // c".

#### length
Returns the length of an array or a string, 0 if the value is not an array.
// TODO: return an error instead to be consistent?

#### reverse
Returns a reversed string or array

#### urlencode
Percent-encodes a string.

Example: `{{ value | urlencode }}`
If value is "/foo?a=b&c=d", the output will be "/foo%3Fa%3Db%26c%3Dd".

Takes an optional argument of characters that shouldn't be percent-encoded (`/` by default). So, to encode slashes as well, you can do `{{ value | urlencode(safe: "") }}`.
